## Overview
As an advisory services and VR/AR development firm, TXR helps companies, organizations and the public sectors understand:
* What is Virtual Reality (VR), what is Augmented Reality (AR) and how VR differs from AR
* The advantages of VR and AR in providing practical, engaging, and more cost-effective workforce training and development
* The key factors to consider when choosing the right technology stack and the right vendor(s) to implement VR/AR training

Below are some of the real-world challenges and problems that companies, organisations and the public sector face when it comes to workforce learning and development:

* In an article written by Dan Pontefract, a former Chief Learning Officer for Telus (10,000+ staff), and published on Forbes [The Wasted Dollars of Corporate Training Programs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danpontefract/2019/09/15/the-wasted-dollars-of-corporate-training-programs/?sh=783e797971f9), it mentioned that in 2018, over $86.7 billion was spent on corporate training and development across the United States. Of that, a fair amount gets wasted for the following reasons: 
    - Learners' recall of the learning content depreciates over time (see article on employee development and the [Forgetting Curve](https://hbr.org/2019/10/where-companies-go-wrong-with-learning-and-development) published by Harvard Business Review).
    - Additionally, staff cannot attend a face to face training session and work at the same time. Their absence from work has a direct impact on the company's productivity for that time. 
    - In most cases, face to face training can also accommodate a small number of participants (average between 20 to 40 at most). Increasing these numbers can have a direct impact on a training session's effectiveness.

* In certain job roles, training staff on dangerous, high risk or diffifult to recreate situations such as surgical procedures, mining incident/ rescue training, fire safety, undersea-cable repairs, climbing at heights training - to name a few, due to the nature of the learning content, traditional training methods do fall short of being effective,realistic or practical and cost-effective.

What's the solution to the above challenges? Train in XR's Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality training solutions are able to solve real-world workforce learning and development challenges for companies, organizations and the public sector by providing more effective, highly engaging and more cost-effective learning solutions. See additional case studies on the effectiveness of VR as a learning solution [here](https://www.interplaylearning.com/blog/virtual-reality-increases-training-effectiveness-10-case-studies). 

Train in XR's website aims to:
* Establish the company's credibility as expert providers of VR and AR services 
* Provide bite-size and easy to digest information that will help demystify VR and AR
* Provide information on whitepapers and case studies written by leading industry players and market practitioners
* Provide information about the best use cases of VR and AR for training
* Sell the company's advisory, VR and AR development services to relevant markets
* Become the leading source of insightful and unbiased information about the pros and cons of adapting VR and AR for workforce training

## Testing

At every stage of the development, testing were carried out to check for potential issues with the code, responsiveness, design and accessibility. I used the developer tools from Chrome, Safari and Microsoft Edge and Firefox.

### Bugs and Corrections
1. Problems with the navbar and the AR iframe overlapping and discovered that using CSS float property on the nav container with an iframe right below it was causinf the issue. The solution was to rewrite the code for the entire header area. This solution includes snippets of JavaScript code from FlorinPop (see Credits section for the screenshot of the borrowed code snippet). 
2. On one of my calls with my mentor, he raised the issues from the Nu Html Checker results such as:
    * button must not appear as descendant of the a element (these errors were on all the buttons on all pages except on the subscribe form)
    * errors from the YouTube videos iframe
    * indent errors and unclosed elements (navlinks error: no li element in scope but a li end tag seen)
   To fix the above, I removed the button tags from the a elements and applied CSS styling to the latter so the links look like buttons. I also fixed the YouTube videos iframe issues by deleting the frameborder and alt text properties. The indent errors and unclosed elements were also fixed by indenting the code uniformly and also removed the extra li closing tag.
3. On Firefox browser, the Book a Demo link on the navigation was not aligning with the rest of the navlinks. This was fixed by shortening the call to action from book a demo to Get Demo.
4. on Firefox, some of the text on homepage were misaligned. The text misalignment issues were fixed by replacing pixels with rem. I found this solution from watching Kevin Powell's YouTube video CSS tutorials. Please see the Credits section. 
5. Feedback from some family members and friends showed that on Firefox and on Safari, the front face and the backface text on the flipcards were overlapping. This was fixed by adding -moz and webkits autoprefixes.
6. Testing the site on Lighthouse showed issues with accessibility, performance and best practices such as wrong placement of the aria labels inside the Font Awesome icons links and focusable elements. This was fixed by moving said aria labels inside the a tags. Alt texts were also added inside the social media a tags and the hamburger menu icon. Lastly, missing keywords were added to the metatags on the header section of all the website pages.
7. W3C CSS Validation showed two missing units to paddings. This was quickly fixed by adding the missing units. Re-testing showed that all errors were gone.
8. W3C Markup Validation showed errors on YouTube video iframes. This was fixed by deleting the obsolete frameborder. 
9. W3C Markup Validation also showed warnings that the document is not mappable to XML 1.0 due to consecutive hyphens in a comment. These warnings were fixed by adjusting the comments above the code for all the sections of all the site pages.
10. Based on the feedback from the team at South Devon College, the following errors were corrected:
    * Fixed all the errors on the about us page (corporate video iframe) by deleting the alt text and the obsolete frameborder CSS property.
    * Removed the unnecessary script tags for libraries such as JQuery, Popper and Bootstrap.
    * Included in the Credits section the screenshots of the code snippets for the navigation menu from FlorinPop and for the use of rem instead of pixel that was learned from Kevin Powell's YouTube tutorials.
    * Renamed some of the assets (images) to remove capitalization to allow for cross-platform compatibility.
    * Tested the JavaScript code snippet on jslint.com and found errors because they do not test for arrow function (ES6). 

11. Added favicon to satisfy error warnings on Chrome DevTools console.
12. The navbar jumps slightly when hovering on the client login link. This was fixed by changing the padding sizes to be the same on normal state and on hover.
13. The backs and faces/ fronts of the flipcards on the services page were not aligned. The bug was caused by a 1rem padding on the media queries for min-280px screen sizes. This was fixed by deleting the errant 1rem padding.

### Validation Results
The W3C Markup Validator and the W3C CSS Validator were used to test and validate every all six pages of the Train in XR site project to ensure that there were no syntax errors in the code. Chrome's Lighthouse DevTool was also used to test for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO.
